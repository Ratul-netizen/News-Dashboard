Tell me what you understood:

Implement the following **two changes only** in the **Source–Platform Network Graph**:

1. **Add Master / Root Node**

   * Introduce a **master (root) node** that represents the **main news post selected for analysis**.
   * This node should:

     * Be created dynamically when the user opens post analysis
     * Display the **main post content** (via click or tooltip)
     * Be visually distinct from all other nodes (unique color, shape, or size)
     * Act as the **origin node**, connecting to all platform nodes
   * Existing **source → platform** relationships must remain unchanged.

2. **Fix Platform Color Mapping**

   * Platform nodes (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, News, Twitter) are currently rendered with the **same color**.
   * Update the color logic so that:

     * Each platform always has a **unique, consistent color**
     * Colors are based on **platform type**, not array index or render order
     * Colors persist across zoom, pan, and re-renders

Only implement these two items.
Do **not** change layout, weights, zoom behavior, or interactions.
